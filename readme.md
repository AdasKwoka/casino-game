# Description

Game design modelled on a well-known gambling game. The aim of the game is to gain as much virtual money as possible.

## How to play

At the beginning you have to set the value of money you want to play for. It cannot be less than or equal to 0 and it cannot exceed the balance of your wallet. Then press the button and wait for the result of the draw. Winning is conditional on drawing the same colours on all the boards or all of them must be different.

## Technology

This is a sample game written mainly using JavaScript with styles added in CSS files. It is based on the OOP model, which means that each functionality was elevated to appropriate classes that meet certain assumptions.
